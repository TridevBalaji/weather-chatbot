<code>

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Discoveries:The JWST continues to send back breathtaking images and data.  Its findings include:
      Early galaxies forming much earlier than predicted, challenging existing theories of the universe's evolution.
      Detailed atmospheric analyses of exoplanets, offering clues about their potential habitability.
      Stunning images of star formation and nebulae, revealing the beauty and complexity of the cosmos. 
Artemis Program:  NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon. 
     Artemis I, an uncrewed mission, successfully launched in 2022, orbiting the Moon and testing systems for future crewed missions.
    Artemis II is planned to send astronauts around the Moon in the next couple of years, a crucial step towards a lunar landing later this decade.
Commercial Spaceflight: Private companies are playing an increasingly prominent role:
     SpaceX continues to develop its Starship program, aiming for human missions to Mars.
     Blue Origin is focused on making space tourism more accessible.
     These companies contribute to research and development, pushing the boundaries of space exploration.
Exoplanet Research: The search for planets beyond our solar system is ongoing:
     Advanced telescopes and analysis techniques are discovering new exoplanets at an incredible rate.
     Scientists are focusing on identifying potentially habitable worlds and searching for signs of life.

example 2:
input:tell about Mars
output:
<code>
General Characteristics:

 Fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system.
 About half the size of Earth.
 Thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide.
 Surface features include volcanoes, canyons, and evidence of past liquid water.

Distinctive Features:

 Olympus Mons: The largest volcano and highest known mountain in our solar system.
 Valles Marineris:  A system of canyons so vast it dwarfs the Grand Canyon on Earth.
 Polar Ice Caps: Composed mostly of water ice with a covering of carbon dioxide ice, these caps expand and contract with the Martian seasons.

Exploration and Missions:

 Numerous robotic missions have explored Mars, including orbiters, landers, and rovers.
 Notable missions:  Viking, Pathfinder, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, Perseverance.
 Perseverance rover is actively searching for signs of ancient life and collecting samples for future return to Earth.

Potential for Life:

 Evidence suggests that Mars may have once had a warmer, wetter climate that could have supported life.
 The search for past or present life is a key focus of Mars exploration.

Future Human Missions:

 NASA's Artemis program includes plans for human missions to Mars in the coming decades.
 Private companies like SpaceX are also developing technologies for Mars colonization.

Mars continues to be a prime target for exploration, holding clues to the history of our solar system and the potential for life beyond Earth.
